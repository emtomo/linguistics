<p>This website is designed to give you an introduction to the field of Linguistics. It contains introductory lessons on a variety of Linguistic topics to give you an overview of the subject and hopefully inspire further interest. The purpose of this website is to make Linguistics accessible and highlight the advantages of studying linguistics to people who may not have heard of this subject before.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-linguistics">What is Linguistics?</h3>
<p>Linguistics is the study of language. Linguists research how language works, how people use it to communicate, how it is acquired and how it changes over time. Linguists study language at different thereotical levels that range in size from small speech sounds to entire conversations.</p>
<ul>
<li>phonetics (the study of the production, acoustics and hearing of speech sounds)</li>
<li>phonology (the patterning of sounds)</li>
<li>morphology (the structure of words)</li>
<li>syntax (the structure of sentences)</li>
<li>semantics (the meaning of language)</li>
<li>pragmatics (language in context)</li>
</ul>
<p>However, Linguistics is a multidiciplinary field and overlaps with other diciplines such as neuroscience, philosophy, psychology, anthropology, sociology, and computer science.</p>
<h3 id="why-learn-about-linguistics">Why learn about Linguistics?</h3>
<p>Language is relevant to almost everything we do as it&rsquo;s such a fundamental part of human life. Learning about Linguistics gives you an insight into how language works and helps to answer questions such as &ldquo;How do words change over time?&rdquo;, &ldquo;What is the role of language in the human mind?&rdquo;, and &ldquo;In what ways is language like a computational system?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Linguistics offers connections to other subjects. For example, Natural Language Processing (NLP) is an emerging field and its progress is ever more present in everyday life. Studying linguistics provides the opportunity to understand the complexity behindand contribute to these technological advances.</p>
<p>Additionally, Linguistics can help develop other skills such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Critical thinking and analytical skills - Linguistics is a science and focuses on analysing data to find patterns and form conclusions</li>
<li>Communication - Linguistic research requires writing papers and teaches the skills necessary to communicate efficiently using evidence and arguments</li>
<li>Logical reasoning - Linguistics involves solving puzzles, whether it is trying to decipher the grammar of a new language or understanding the patterns of sounds</li>
</ul>
