                                    <h3 id="what-is-mophology">What is mophology?</h3>
<p>Morphology is the study of the form and structure of words.</p>
<h3 id="morphemes">Morphemes</h3>
<p>The smallest unit of language that has meaning is a morpheme. If you try to think of an example of units of language which cannot be broken into smaller parts you discover that here are different types of morphemes - those that are words in their own right (eg. book), and those that are not (eg. plural -s). These are called free morphemes and bound morphemes respectively. Bound morphemes are called affixes. If the affix attaches to the left of the stem it is a suffix, and if it attaches to the right of the stem it is a suffix.</p>
<h3 id="functions-of-morphemes">Functions of morphemes</h3>
<p>A morpheme can give semantic meaning (tells us something about the denotation of the word) and/or grammatical meaning (tells us something about the grammatical category of the word). For example <em>reader</em> is made up of the morphemes <em>read</em> and <em>-er</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>read</em> - verb: denotes an action</li>
<li><em>-er</em> - morpheme turns the word into a noun (but -er on its own does not)</li>
<li><em>speaker</em> - noun: denotes an individual</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/morphology.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Words can contain one morpheme (mono-morphemic eg. window) or multiple morphemes (poly-morphemic eg. ). Every word that contains more than one morpheme has a stem which is the core part of the word. The stem determines the semantic meaning of the word and other morphemes attach to it. In the example below, <em>constitut-</em> is the stem and the other morphemes attach to it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Constitut-e</li>
<li>Constitu-tion</li>
<li>Constitu-tion-al</li>
<li>Constitu-tion-al-ly</li>
</ul>
<p>Morphemes have specific grammatical roles and so combine in a specified order. Morphemes which attach to the right of words change the category of the thing they attach to. How do we know whether a word is a verb, noun, adjective or adverb? Words in the same category behave in the same way. For example (with some exceptions): only nouns combine with <em>-s</em> morpheme; only verbs combine with tense morphemes; and only adjectives can appear in context &ldquo;The __ Noun&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Morphemes select the constituent that they attach to - this is called c-selection. They do not attach to any word and change its category. For example <em>-al</em> attaches to nouns such as <em>nation</em> to form the adjective <em>national</em>, but it doesn&rsquo;t attach to other categories for words such as verbs: <em>run</em> + <em>-al</em> =&gt; * <em>runal</em>. This process can be repeated for polymorphemeic words with morphemes attaching to the right of the stem:</p>
<p><img src="/nation.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="compound-words">Compound words</h3>
<p>Compound words consist of two free morphemes, eg. handbag, butterfly, pushchair. With English compound words, the rightmost word determines the category and grammatical properties of the compound - this is called the English Right-Hand Head Rule (RHHR). From the previous examples you can verify this.</p>
<p>The RHHR also applies to affixation such as with the example <em>nationalisation</em>. The right most element of the word is the head of the word. Infact, the RHHR applies to all morphological combinations.</p>

<p>Phonetics is the study of human speech.</p>
<h3 id="how-do-humans-speak">How do humans speak?</h3>
<p>To speak, air from the lungs travels to the larynx where the air either vibrates the vocal folds or is allowed to pass through. The airflow is shaped by the articulators in the mouth and nose.</p>
<h3 id="how-are-different-sounds-produced">How are different sounds produced?</h3>
<p>To produce different sounds, we control parts of the mouth and nose to shape the air. These <strong>articulators</strong> include the tongue, lips and teeth, the alveolar ridge, the palate, the velum, and the nasal cavity.</p>
<h3 id="ipa-chart">IPA chart</h3>
<p>The International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) is a set of symbols used by linguists to describe the sounds of spoken language. You can see the IPA chart and hear the sounds <a href="https://www.ipachart.com/">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="place-of-articulation">Place of articulation</h3>
<p>Linguists give names to the different sounds depending on the <strong>place of articulation</strong>. The different places of articulation for consonants are shown in the table below.</p>

<h3 id="manner-of-articulation">Manner of articulation</h3>
<p>As well as using the ariculators to change the speach sound, we can also change how the sound is produced, this is called changing the <strong>manner of articulation</strong>. We can change the airflow to be oral or nasal (if the velum is raised the airflow is oral and if the velum is lowered the airflow is nasal), and we can change the degree of oral stricture (how close are the articulators). The table below explains the different ways of changing the manner of articulation.</p>

<p>Sounds can also be voiced - meaning the vocal folds in the larynx vibrate - or unvoiced. Place your hand on the front of your neck and see if you can feel the difference when saying <em>ssss</em> vs <em>zzzz</em>. You should notice vibrations when saying the latter as <em>z</em> is voiced whereas <em>s</em> is unvoiced.</p>
<h3 id="vowels">Vowels</h3>
<p>To produce vowels the articulators are not very close together. It can be difficult to notice the diference in how different vowels are produced. Linguistics describe vowels in terms of the height of highest part of the tongue (close, close-mid, open-mid, open), front vs. back position of the tongue (front, central, back) and the degree of lip-rounding (rounded, spread).</p>
<p>To help with describing how vowels sound, Daniel Jones developed the idea of cardinal vowels. These are reference vowels to allow linguists to describe how vowels produced in natural speech sound. There are 8 primary cardinal vowels (numbered 1-8 from the top left anti-clockwise to the top right as shown in the diagram below). You can listen to the cardinal vowels <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6UIAe4p2I74">here</a>. The vowels used in English are:</p>
<ul>
<li>i - heed</li>
<li>ɪ - hid</li>
<li>ɛ - head</li>
<li>æ - had</li>
<li>ɑ - father</li>
<li>ʊ - good</li>
<li>u - food</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a chart of the vowels - the cardinal vowels are shown in red circles.</p>

                                    <h3 id="what-is-semantics">What is semantics?</h3>
<p>Semantics is the study of meaning in language.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-meaning">What is meaning?</h3>
<p>This is a hard concept to define and is a question that philosophers have been debating for centuries. When understanding the meaning of an utterance, the meaning is determined by the meaning of its parts, and the way they are put together - this is called the <strong>Principle of Compositionality</strong>.</p>
<p>There is also a difference between the literal sentence meaning and the communicated meaning of a sentence. The meaning associated with a sentence is called a <strong>proposition</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="inference">Inference</h3>
<p>An inference is a conclusion that can be reasonably drawn from a sentence. There are three different types:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Entailment</strong> - the most basic and strongest type of inference - anything that follows directly from the literal truth of a sentence. <em>John has a son</em> entails that <em>John has at least one child</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Presupposition</strong> - a presupposition is something that we must assume to be true for a sentence to make sense. <em>Mary&rsquo;s bother tried to call her</em> presupposes that <em>Mary has a brother</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Implicature</strong> - what is suggested, although not expressed nor entailed by an utterance. If asked <em>is Tom clever?</em> Alice replies <em>he is very kind</em> then the implicature is that <em>Tom is not clever</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>When telling apart entailments and presuppositions, it is useful to note that presuppositions hold true under negation of the main clause but entailments do not. For example, for the utterances <em>John realised he was late for work</em> and <em>John did not realise he was late for work</em>, the presupposition <em>John was late for work</em> is the same.</p>
<h3 id="types-of-implicature">Types of implicature</h3>
<p>Implicatures can be split into two main types: <strong>conventional</strong> and <strong>conversational</strong>.</p>
<p>Conventional implicatures context independent and arise as a function of linguistic forms, eg. the difference between <em>and</em> and <em>but</em>: <em>John laughed and Mary cried</em>. <em>John laughed but Mary cried</em>.</p>
<p>Conversational implicatures are context dependent meaning that in different contexts, different implicatures arise. They also have the propities of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cancellability - more information can be added to change the implicature</li>
<li>Non-detachability - implicature is attached to the proposition of a sentence rather than the sentence itself, so if an utterance is paraphrased, the implicature will remain constant</li>
<li>Calculability - conversational implicatures are not random and can be calculable based on a set of general principles (i.e. is not a preestablished code)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-cooperative-principle-and-grices-maxims">The Cooperative Principle and Grice’s maxims</h3>
<p>One of the most influential accounts of the calculation of conversational implicature was Grice’s cooperative principle. The cooperative principle assumes that discourse participants are helpful to each other. Conversational implicatures (CIs) can arise from either adhering to, or flouting one or more of the maxims below:</p>
<ol>
<li>quality: be maximally truthful - e.g. <em>I married a pig</em> flouts the maxim of quality as it is clearly false so gives rise to the CI: <em>I married someone really greedy</em></li>
<li>quantity: don’t say too much or too little - e.g. <em>Some of the students passed</em> gives rise to the scalar implicature that not all of the students passed.</li>
<li>relation: be relevant - e.g. a. <em>Are the neighbours home?</em> b. <em>Their car isn’t in their driveway</em> flouts the maxim of relevance so implicates that <em>The neighbours are not home.</em></li>
<li>manner: be clear - e.g. a. <em>Is that your sister?</em> b. <em>Well, she&rsquo;s my mother&rsquo;s daughter</em> flouts the maxim of manner so implicates that they are not close.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="sense-and-reference">Sense and Reference</h3>
<p>One question philiosophers have been debating for years is how do words relate to the world? Some phrases, such as proper nouns and definite descriptions, simply refer directly to the person in the world that they describe. This is called <strong>direct reference</strong>. However, we can demonstrate that there must be something other than just direct refecrence through the problem of empty statements. For example, <em>The King of France is bald</em> is a meaningful statement but the <em>King of France</em> does not denote a real person in the world.</p>
<h3 id="frege-and-russell">Frege and Russell</h3>
<p>Frege and Russell were influential philiosophers who developed solutions to this problem.</p>
<p>Frege wrote a paper called <em>Über Sinn und Bedeutung</em> and distinguished between the reference and sense of a linguistic expression. He defined <strong>reference</strong> as a direct relationship between words and the things in the world they talk about. Whereas <strong>sense</strong> constitutes a word’s meaning independently of circumstances.<br>
Therefore, empty staments like the example above are meaningful because, despite having no refence, they have sense. Under the Fregean view, definite NPs presuppose existance and uniqueness. The sense of the description allows us to understand who the referent is, however if there is no referent then the sentence cannot sensibly be uttered. Frege therefore interprets empty statements as unjudgeable.</p>
<p>Russell took a different view. He argued that words had only one layer of meaning. His solution was that while proper names directly refer, more complex phrases do not. Specifically, definite descriptions are in fact hidden quantificational statements. For example, the definite description <em>The Prime Minister likes cake</em> means <em>There is exactly one Prime Minister and that person likes cake</em>. Consequently, the problem of empty statements goes away as the example b above means <em>There is exactly one King of France and that person is bald</em>, which is false but meaningful.</p>

                                    <h3 id="what-is-sociolinguistics">What is sociolinguistics?</h3>
<p>Sociolinguistics is concerned with the use of different linguistic variants in particular linguistic and social contexts, to understand how language variation is structured linguistically and socially, and how and why language changes.</p>
<h3 id="linguistic-variables">Linguistic Variables</h3>
<p>A linguistic variable is a set of alternative ways that something can be said. These different ways of saying the same thing are called <strong>variants</strong>. There are differnt types of variation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Syntactic/grammatical = sentence structure/grammatical relations<br>
E.g. He won’t go / He’ll not go</li>
<li>Lexis = words<br>
E.g. He’s clever / bright / brainy</li>
<li>Morphological = structure of words<br>
E.g. worse / worser</li>
<li>Phonetic and phonological = sounds<br>
E.g. I’m feeli[ŋ]/[n] good</li>
<li>Discourse-pragmatic = discourse-level features<br>
E.g. So / right / you know / well / innit</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="constraints">Constraints</h3>
<p>The factors that affect variants are called constraints. E.g. social class, region, age, gender, the individual, linguistic factors.</p>
<h3 id="languages-dialects-and-accents">Languages, Dialects and Accents</h3>
<p>Would you consider Spanish a language or a dialect? What about Mandarin? Why? It is likely due to social or political reasons as it is hard to linguistically define languages. <strong>Mutually intelligibility</strong> - whether speakers or different languages can understand each other - is often used to distinguish between languages and dialects, however there are mutually intelligible &ldquo;languages&rdquo; (Czech and Slovak), and mutually unintelligible &ldquo;dialects&rdquo; (Mandarin and Cantonese).</p>
<p>The difference between accents and dialects is easier to define. An accent is a way of pronouncing a language variety (only how it sounds), whereas a dialect is variety of language, including words, morphology and grammar. For example Received Pronounciation (RP) is a regionally neutral accent in British English, and Standard English is a dialect of English which is accepted as the standard.</p>
<h3 id="regional-variation">Regional variation</h3>
<p>Across the British Isles there are many varieties of English spoken. These varieties tend to cluster geographically. We might notice that speakers from Newcastle speak in a way distinctive from speakers from Essex, for example. Linguists study these regional differences and can mark linguistic differences between
geographical areas on maps. The example below is from a <a href="http://projects.alc.manchester.ac.uk/ukdialectmaps/lexical-variation/bread/">study</a> by Mackenzie et al. (2012-16) of the different words used for bread across the UK.</p>

                                    <h3 id="what-is-syntax">What is syntax</h3>
<p>Syntax is the study of the structure of language.</p>
<h3 id="constituency">Constituency</h3>
<p>Sentences are made up of sub-groups of words. These <strong>constituents</strong> are a string of words in a sentence that speakers can manipulate as a single chunk. We have tests we can use to see if a string of words is a constituent. Note that one negative test does not mean the string is not a constituent.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Substitution</strong>
If we can replace a string of words with something else we have good reason to believe is a unit (say a single word) without significantly changing the meaning, then we can conclude that the original string was a constituent, and that the whole constituent is of the same category as the single word.<br>
For example, &ldquo;Mary sang a song in the hall.&rdquo; &ldquo;<strong>She</strong> sang <strong>it</strong> in the hall.&rdquo; So <em>Mary</em> and <em>a song</em> are both constituents (among some others).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ellipsis</strong>
If we can delete a string of words and the sentence still makes sense, then that string is a constituent.<br>
For example, &ldquo;John will eat those chips and Bill will <del>eat those chips</del> too.&rdquo; So <em>eat those chips</em> is a constituent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Coordination</strong>
If a string of words can be connected to another string with <em>and</em> (coordinated), then each string is a constituent and they are of the same category.<br>
For example, &ldquo;John will <em>eat those chips</em> and <em>drink the lemonade</em>.&rdquo;<br>
&quot; John will eat <em>those chips</em> and <em>the apple</em>.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Topicalisation</strong>
If a string of words can be moved to the front of the sentence, it suggests that string is a constituent.<br>
For example, &ldquo;<em>Those chips</em>, John will eat tomorrow&rdquo;.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="x-bar-theory">X-bar theory</h3>
<p>X-bar theory states that every phrase has the same core organisation.<br>
According to x-bar theory, every phrase has a head. The head is the node that has no daughters (called terminal node). Whatever category the head is determines the category of the phrase. The diagram below shows the general phrase structure. The specifier and the complement are in parentheses to show that they might not necessarily be in every phrase.</p>

<h3 id="tense-phrases-tp">Tense Phrases (TP)</h3>
<p>A sentense is a tense phrase<br>
Sometimes tense is shown with bound morphology (e.g. past <em>-ed</em>, present <em>-s</em>) and other times auxiliary verbs show tense (e.g. <em>will, has, was</em>). For untensed sentences, i.e. infinitives, English uses <em>to</em> to mark tense. The sister of T is VP. T&rsquo; dominates the head T and VP and the sister of this constituent (T’) is the subject of the sentence.</p>
<h3 id="complementiser-phrases-cp">Complementiser phrases (CP)</h3>
<p>Complementiser phrases are clauses. They start with <em>that, whether, if, for</em>. For example, <em>For him to win</em> is a CP.</p>
<h3 id="verb-phrases-vp">Verb Phrases (VP)</h3>
<p>To decide on the structure of VPs, it is helpful to consider an example.<br>
(1) John will eat a banana before tomorrow.<br>
Using the constituency tests we can see that there are two VPs in (1): <em>eat a banana before tomorrow</em> and <em>eat a banana</em>. We can also observe that <em>before tomorrow</em> is not required but <em>a banana</em> is obligatory. This is because the former is an <strong>adjunct</strong> which is not directly selected by the head and is a sister of the phrase. The latter is a <strong>complement</strong> which is a sister of the head. Complements merge with the head before adjuncts are merged. The structure is shown below.</p>

<h3 id="determiner-phrases-dp">Determiner Phrases (DP)</h3>
<p>Determiners in English are articles (<em>a, the</em>), demonstratives (<em>this, these, that, those</em>), quantifiers (<em>one, two etc.</em>) and possessives (<em>&rsquo;s</em>). Determiners select noun phrases.</p>
<h3 id="noun-phrases-np">Noun Phrases (NP)</h3>
<p>Noun phrases can have adjuncts and complements. Let&rsquo;s look at another example.
(2) I met the student of biology from America.<br>
We can conclude from the substitution constituency test (substitute the NPs with <em>the one</em>) that <em>of biology</em> is obligatory and is a complement, and <em>from America</em> can be omitted and is therefore an adjunct. In NPs, the complements to N can be CPs or PPs. Adjuncts can be adjectives (APs), PPs, and relative clauses.</p>
<h3 id="adjective-phrases-ap">Adjective Phrases (AP)</h3>
<p>Adjective phrases can also take complements and adjuncts. For example in the AP <em>extremely proud of him</em>, <em>of him</em> is a complement whereas <em>extremely</em> is an adjunct.</p>
<h3 id="prepositional-phrases-pp">Prepositional Phrases (PP)</h3>
<p>Phrases headed by prepositions can take complements and adjuncts. See if you decide which is the complement and adjunct in the following example: <em>directly below the picture</em>.</p>
